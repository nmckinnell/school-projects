**Wellesley Coursewire** was created by Nora McKinnell for CS 304 taken as an independent study in Spring 2013 under advisement from Prof. Scott Anderson. A live version is available on request. [Read the full documentation here!](paper.html)

It was created in PHP with a MySQL database using course information given to CS 349a students by the Registrar in Spring 2012. The front end was built with Bootstrap using a premade theme from Bootswatch.

The calendar used in the planner is created using FullCalendar, an open source jQuery plugin developed by Adam Shaw.
