Using a case study approach, we will explore the nature of audio-visual communication/representation in historical, cultural, disciplinary, and media-specific contexts, and examine different theoretical and critical perspectives on the role and power of media to influence our social values, political beliefs, identities, and behaviors. We'll also consider how consumers of media representations can and do contest and unsettle their embedded messages. Our emphasis will be on developing the research and analytical tools, modes of reading, and forms of critical practice that can help us to negotiate the increasingly mediated world in which we live.","None.

Their texts exemplify the contradictory qualities British humor typically comprises  its wild exaggerations and dry wit, silly exuberance and cutting social criticism, eccentricity and cool detachment. We will also consider humor in a larger sense: the notion of character and personality these writers developed, and connections between it and evolving gender, economic, political, and cultural relations in the period. Beyond merely amusing, the personalities unfolded in this literature are introspective and unsettled, skeptical and devout, sociable and sensitive, ambitious and curious, and help give the eighteenth century its distinctive flavor.",None,Language and Literature,,,MTh,11:10 am - 12:20 pm,Science Center 377,,, ,N/A,,,

We explore the major texts in the history of film theory, from early writings on film as an emergent medium to contemporary post-cinema discourses on digital convergence. Topics include cinematic specificity, indexicality, theories of ideology, spectatorship and reception, structuralism and poststructuralism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, postcolonial, feminist and queer theories.

After developing quantitative descriptions of electricity and magnetism, we explore the relations between them, leading us to an understanding of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon.

The electric and magnetic forces are entirely responsible for the structures and interactions of atoms and molecules, the properties of all solids, and the structure and function of biological material. Our technological society is largely dependent on the myriad applications of the physics of electricity and magnetism, e.g., motors and generators, communications systems, and the architecture of computers. After developing quantitative descriptions of electricity and magnetism, we explore the relations between them, leading us to an understanding of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon. The course will consider both ray-optics and wave-optics descriptions of light. Laboratory exercises will emphasize electrical circuits, electronic measuring instruments, optics, and optical experiments.

'Why cannot we write the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittannica on the head of a pin?' When the physicist Richard Feynman first asked that question a half century ago, the word nanoscience had yet to be used. Today, nanoscience and nanotechnology have created a great deal of interest not only from scientists and engineers but also from the general public. This course focuses on the emergence of nanoscience and nanotechnology over the last several decades. Questions we will addressed include what is the nature of nanoscience and nanotechnology, what are the principles that enable us to predict behavior over nanometer length scales, how are nanomaterials made and organized, and how is nanotechnology likely to impact our lives. Study of current research in the areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology will form the core of the course. We will use the primary literature, popular portrayals, and interactions with researchers in nanoscience as avenues to explore the field.","120/205, 211, and one additional science course at the 200 level",Natural and Physical Science,,,Th,01:30 pm - 04:00 pm,Science Center 104,,, ,N/A,,,

In this seminar, we will explore: the relationship between science and religion; the effects of rising pluralism at home and global exploration overseas; witchcraft; the secularization and commercialization of daily life; the separation of church and state; and the formation of the first supra-national identities that transcended traditional religious boundaries.

Many of its techniques of knowledge production were honed within the colonial context. In the postcolonial period, these techniques have been taken up by scholars within the region and beyond to update and challenge longstanding understandings of the region. Much historical and recent scholarship grapples with how one ought to understand the unique nature of the region's forms of culture and social organization, and to place them in relation to modernity and the West. South Asia proves an insistently fruitful case for assessing the universality or provincial nature of western social theory and to consider the connections between knowledge and power. In this course, students will come to comprehend and assess the history of ethnography and anthropology in India, Pakistan, and other parts of South Asia.

Etruscan artists also served the early kings of Rome, and we find their work at the heart of this ancient city. At the same time, Celtic tribes dominated much of Europe, and their tombs reveal a fascination for Greek and Etruscan art.
