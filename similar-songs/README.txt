Interacts with the last.fm API to generate webpages with information for 5 songs similar to a given song inputted by the user.

How to use: Run the file datacollection.py. This will ask you to enter a track name. Based on the song you entered, 6 JSON files will be created. Then, the datacollection.py file will also invoke a function from musicplayer.py that will generate all 6 HTML files. You can then view the HTML files in your browser (start with album-main.html) for information about the top 5 songs similar to the one you originally inputted.

Requires: Python 2.7
